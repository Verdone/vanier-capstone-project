# Capstone Project - CEGEP Vanier College, Computer Science and Mathematics Program

### Summary
For the last semester of the 200.C0 program at Vanier College, a capstone project was assigned to groups of students that would reflect what was taught in previous courses. Aside from coding, students were taught about Scrum/Agile workflows, the software development cycle, how to breakdown project activites with Trello, write PCA Reports, and eventually presented their projects in-class. In this repository, the code for the application has been made accessible.

Our group created two educational and interactive simulations related to physics: the first was for Newton's laws of motion, and the second was for standing waves. Laurenz and I were responsible for programming and designing the standing waves simulation.

The tools used for this project were Java, JavaFX, & CSS â€” while JSON was also used to fetch data and pictures relating to the simulations.

My final grade for this class was 100%. If you are stumbling upon this repo and are a student at Vanier working on their capstone project right now, good luck!

### Additional Information

Check out the download page for the [JSON-simple JAR](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads) file along with the one for [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) and [how to run it](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/), as these are necessary to run the desktop application on a device.
