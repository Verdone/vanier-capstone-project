### Summary
For the last semester of the 200.C0 program at Vanier College, a capstone project was assigned to groups of students that would reflect what was taught in previous courses: this project also included a breakdown of project activites with Trello, writing PCA Reports, and an in-class presentation. In this repository, the code for the application has been made accessible.

Our group created two educational and interactive simulations related to physics: the first was for Newton's laws of motion, and the second was for standing waves. Laurenz and I were responsible for programming and designing the standing waves simulation.

The tools used for this project were Java, JavaFX, and CSS â€” while JSON was also used to fetch data and pictures relating to the simulations.

My final grade for this class was 100%. If you are stumbling upon this repo and are a student at Vanier working on their capstone project right now, good luck!
